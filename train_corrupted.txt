There is a court order found in Ur, dated to the sixteenth year of Nazi-Maruttaš (1292 BC), in which Šubši-mašrâ-šakkan is given the title šakin māti, lúGAR KUR, “governor of the country.” It is an injunction forbidding harvesting reeds from a certain river or canal.
The poetic work Ludlul bēl nēmeqi describes how the fortunes of ŠubšimašrâŠakkan a rich man of high rank turned one day
When beset by ominous signs, he incurred the wrath of the king, and seven courtiers plotted every kind of mischief against him.
This resulted in him losing his property, “they have divided all my possessions among foreign riffraff,” friends, “my city frowns on me as an enemy; indeed my land is savage and hostile,” physical strength, “my flesh is flaccid, and my blood has ebbed away,” and health, as he relates that he “wallowed in my excrement like a sheep.” While slipping into and out of consciousness on his death bed, his family already conducting his funeral, Urnindinlugga, a kalû, or incantation priest, was sent by Marduk to presage his salvation.
The work concludes with a prayer to Marduk.

As Jan Pietrzak notes, he rarely wrote such serious pieces, but he was motivated to do so in 1976, after the workers' protests in the Ursus factory.

The communist authorities tried to repress the song which is one of the reasons why despite numerous performances – some gathering thousands of people on the streets all chanting – there are no recordings from that period
One of the largest public performances took place in Warsaw, at the crossroads of major streets (Aleje Jerozolimskie and Marszałkowska Street).
For his support of the anticommunist opposition Pietrzak was arrested in the aftermath of the introduction of the martial law in Poland in 1981

Following Ofcom relaxations on local programming requirements, the station began taking UTV Radio's networked evening and overnight shows in late March 2009.

Programme management, production, administrative, engineering and management resources were to be shared between the two stations, but the programming on Central Radio remained editorially focused on the Preston, Leyland and Chorley areas.
In December 2010 Niocom sold Dune FM and from 1 February 2011 the programming syndication ended with Central Radio becoming as a fully independent service
On 14 June 2011 it was announced that UKRD, owners of the 107 The Bee in neighbouring Blackburn had purchased the Central Radio licence and planned to merge the service with its East Lancashire station 107 The Bee.
Three days later, Central Radio ceased broadcasting with Drivetime presenter - Leyland born Andy Hilbert - playing the final record, Unforgettable by Nat King Cole.

Seismologist Nicholas Ambraseys described one account of the effects at Ramallah as destructive and with a large loss of life (15,000 deaths, several hundred of which were boys at a school).
He also expanded on the effects to the north in Banyas where 100 were killed and in Jerusalem where the roof of the Dome of the Rock was displaced and then returned to its former position

The event in 1212 caused significant damage to towns in the Arabah Valley as well as the destruction of a church on the Sinai Peninsula
In 1293, near the southern portion of the Dead Sea, an earthquake destroyed three towers of a castle and caused damage between the Dead Sea and Gaza.
In 1458, another event again affected the southern Dead Sea area, this time causing a 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) left-lateral offset at the Tilah Castle.
The castle was built across the fault during Roman or Byzantine times and the building that housed the water tank sustained the displacement.

During the Meuse-Argonne offensive they would fight for 21 straight days, moving over 6 miles (9.7 km), throwing back elements of six enemy divisions, and suffering a staggering 4,781 casualties in the process.
After the Armistice was signed the TwentyNinth Division was brought home in July 1919 and dissipated
The 1st Battalion, 115th Infantry, is authorized two campaign streamers for its service in World War I: one for Alsace and one for Meuse-Argonne.

Later the 1–115th and other Maryland units were organized into the 58th Infantry Brigade whose units were located entirely in Maryland
In 1984 requirements changed again, prompting the reactivation of the 29th Infantry Division as a new, streamlined "Light" Infantry Division, ready to meet the demands of an ever-changing national defense, now and into the 21st century.

As part of this reactivation the 58th Infantry Brigade became the 3rd Brigade 29th Infantry Division
Elements of the brigade included the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 115th Infantry.
In October 2001 in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on the continental United States the battalions of the 115th were called to active federal service as part of Operation Noble Eagle
The 115th carried out critical security duties protecting US federal installations from threats to the national security
On 6 January 2005, Company B, 1–115th Infantry, mobilized again for active duty as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
They were assigned as part of the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), based in Georgia, for this operation.

The Grantvillers undertake to defend south central Thuringia with the aid of a cavalry detachment from king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden's Green Regiment, and fights several battles which convince various polities to join the NUS.
By early 1632, their informal alliance with Gustavus and with Jews, their manufacturing capabilities, and their defeats of Catholic armies draws serious and well-designed concerted efforts to attack the "republican cancer" growing in Thuringia, and Grantville itself is attacked, teaching Stearns that he needs a protector to "buy time", even as the "up-timers" have determined that to retain as much technology as possible they need to "gear down" to a late nineteenth-century technology base while their modern equipment is still operable.

One theme of the series is of down-timer leaders trying to change, hasten or head off their histories while the acts of ordinary citizens going about their day-to-day affairs and of the leaders of Grantville effect more fundamental societal and political changes.

In September 1904 the first general strike in Italy took place
The strike was called by the Chambers of Labor in several cities in response to several killings of striking workers, culminating in the shooting of a miner in Buggerru, Sardinia.
Participation was strongest in the north and the Po Valley.
The government headed by Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti ordered local authorities to intervene as little as possible predicting that the strike would die down on its own which it did
Nevertheless, it shook public confidence in the strength of the state and the middle class's support for Giolitti.

Private trade and private transport were forbidden, at the same time Mongolia's livestock economy was to be collectivized, the feudal nobles were expropriated, the Buddhist church was targeted by excessive taxes, lamas were transferred to secular life, and many monasteries forcibly closed.
The state-sponsored transport and trade organizations were not at all able to replace the old, private-owned networks, and neglect and mismanagement in the newly founded collectives (Mongolian: khamtral) led to the loss of 7 million heads of livestock, or one third of the 1929 level.
All this resulted not only in a steady stream across the border to Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, but also to local uprisings—for example, the uprising at Tögsbuyant monastery of Uvs aimag, which lasted from March to May 1930.

The insurgents founded a high command under the name ‘’Ochirbatyn yaam’’ (Mongolian: Ochirbat’s ministry), and began arming the local lamas and lay people, burning down collective and sum centres, and killing opponents, especially targeting officials, party and youth league members who actively fought with religion for introduction of socialism.

The 69 members of Parliament were elected from 69 single-member constituencies, an increase from 65 used for the previous elections in 1972.
The deposit was increased for the first time, rising to $1,200 from $500.
A total of 124 candidates contested the election
The ruling PAP was the only party to contest every one of 69 constituencies, while the five other opposition parties (namely Barisan Sosialis, the Singapore Justice Party, PKMS, the United Front and the Workers' Party) formed a Joint Opposition Council to cooperate at the polls.
The Workers' Party nominated 22 candidates and United Front 14; no other party put forward more than six candidates, while two candidates ran as independents.
The election marked their political debut of two prominent candidates, independent Chiam See Tong and PAP Goh Chok Tong, who would went on to become the then-longest-serving opposition MP and the second Prime Minister, respectively.

Arnoux, having qualified fourth, had been unable to start his car on the grid, and began the race from the back of the pack.

At this point in the race both Irvine and Häkkinen were well out of the points, meaning that if the order stayed the same Frentzen, Irvine, and Häkkinen would have all been tied for the points lead with two races to go, with Coulthard six points behind them.

Coulthard inherited the lead and stayed out front until the rain came back with a vengeance
The Scot chose to stay out on dry tyres while most pitted for wets which ultimately proved to be a costly mistake as he slid off the road and out of the race on the 38th lap as the conditions worsened

Behind him, Irvine and Häkkinen had fought their way back into contention for points, with Irvine holding 6th ahead of Häkkinen.
After cruising for most of the race, Häkkinen turned up the pressure, eventually forcing Irvine into a mistake and taking 6th place.
At the front Barrichello tried everything to pass Trulli for 2nd and make it a Stewart 1–2 but ultimately had to settle for 3rd
Meanwhile, Häkkinen caught and passed Gené for 5th to earn 2 invaluable points, but the Spaniard held onto 6th ahead of Irvine to give Minardi their first point in four seasons.

Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello sat on the negotiating committee for the league, although he had little to say early on in the proceedings.
However, he was invited to a January meeting by the players' union in an attempt to breach sides; Lamoriello was invited because of the respect for the manner in which he ran the Devils organization.
That meeting was ultimately unfruitful, although it did lead to further talks between the players and the owners.

An illegal modification to his Hummers engine then saw Gordon disqualified though he continued to compete under appeal for the remainder of the rally
He would have finished fifth in the overall classification with three further stage wins Toyota driver Lucio Alvarez inheriting the position as a result of Gordon losing the appeal
Never outside the top two of the overall classification, the event was dominated by Iveco driver Gérard de Rooy.
After finishing second to fellow Dutch competitor Marcel van Vliet in the opening stage, de Rooy won the second to lead the overall classification and re-took the lead after victory in the fourth stage.
He consolidated his lead with two more successive stage victories, opening a 15-minute advantage over Aleš Loprais before the Tatra driver was forced to retire after an accident in the non-timed section of the ninth stage.
De Rooy then held a 47minute advantage over teammate Hans Stacey a gap he extended to 51 minutes by the end of the event with a final stage victory in the twelfth stage
Stacey secured second in the overall standings despite not having won any stages, with Artur Ardavichus the best of the Kamaz entries in third position – 1 hour and 47 minutes down on de Rooy with victory in the tenth stage to his credit.

The case was a highly mediatized case involving Daniel "Dan" York Drill-Mellum, a student at the University of Minnesota and fraternity member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Drill-Mellum violently raped 19-year-old Abby Honold twice at his apartment in November 2014 after luring her from a Minnesota Golden Gophers tailgate.
He left claw marks on her body, bit chunks of her breasts, and shoved his fist so far into her mouth that he tore open part of her tongue during the attack.
After escaping, Honold immediately went to a hospital where a nurse described the injuries as some of the worst she'd ever seen.

Istanbul had already been subjected to three terrorist attacks in the first half of 2016 including suicide attacks in January and in March that were both linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL and a car bombing in early June claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks TAK a radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party PKK

It was suggested that Turkey was paying a price for former Prime Minister and now President Recip Tayyip Erdoğans wilful blindness to ISIL threat and that Turkey after previously being a conduit for fighters joining ISIL was beginning to feel the wrath of the group for taking a harder line
The Washington Post wrote that perhaps not by chance what was merely the latest in a series of Islamic State attacks inside Turkey came just as its impulsive and increasingly autocratic president was moving to repair his regime’s threadbare foreign relations
Shortly before 22:00 Istanbul time, two assailants approached the x-ray scanner at a security checkpoint, and opened fire.

In advancing its plans for the defense of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, the joint Army-Navy board recommended the establishment of eight aeronautic stations which, with a strength of two dirigibles and six or eight seaplanes each, could immediately conduct patrol work.
Significantly, the only site definitely advanced as vital in the overall plan was that at the Coco Solo United States Navy submarine base near Colón in the Canal Zone.
The Army selected Captain Henry H. Arnold, then in training at the Army Aviation School at Rockwell Field, near San Diego, to proceed immediately to the Canal Zone and form and command an aviation squadron there.
This unit was designated the 7th Aero Squadron and was organized on 29 March 1917

On 11 January 1890 the British government of Lord Salisbury sent the Portuguese government an ultimatum in the form of a "memorandum", demanding the retreat of the Portuguese military forces led by Serpa Pinto from the territory between the colonies of Angola and Mozambique (in the current Zimbabwe and Zambia), an area claimed by Portugal under the Pink Map.

The situation was aggravated by the severe financial crisis that occurred between 1890 and 1891, when the money sent from emigrants in Brazil decreased by 80% with the so-called crisis of encilhamento following the proclamation of the republic in Brazil two months previously, an event that was followed with apprehension by the monarchic government and with jubilation by the defenders of the republic in Portugal.

The original route intersected with a Municipal Guard outpost which forced the column to follow a different route.
After a few confrontations with the police and civilians, it finally found the column led by Palla.

Rotunda and Alcântara were occupied, but concrete plans for the revolution had not yet been decided and the main leaders hadn't yet appeared.
In spite of this, the beginning of the events did not occur favorably for the rebels.
The three cannon shots – the accorded signal for the civilians and military to advance – did not take place.

Reinforcements from the Setúbal peninsula were also unlikely to arrive, since the Tagus river was controlled by rebel ships.
Towards the end of the day the situation was difficult for the monarchical forces: the rebel ships were docked beside the Palace Square and the cruiser São Rafael opened fire on the ministry buildings in the bewildered sight of the Brazilian diplomatic corps aboard battleship São Paulo, whose passenger list included the elected president Hermes da Fonseca.

They were playing bridge when the rebels began an attack on the building.
The king attempted some phone calls but, finding that the lines had been cut, managed only to inform the Queen Mother, who was in Pena National Palace, about the situation.
Soon afterwards, groups of units that were loyal to the king arrived at the scene and managed to defeat the attacks of the revolutionaries.
At 9 oclock the king received a phone call from the president of the Council advising him to find refuge in Mafra or Sintra since the rebels were threatening to bomb the Palace of Necessidades

In the meantime, Counsellor João de Azevedo Coutinho arrived and advised the king to call to Mafra the queens D. Amélia and D. Maria Pia (respectively, the king's mother and grandmother), who were in the palaces of Pena and Vila in Sintra, and to prepare to continue on to Porto, where they would organise a resistance.
In Lisbon, the king's departure did not bring a large advantage to the government since the majority of the troops now available to engage the rebel forces did not follow the orders to march to Rossio Square to prevent the concentration of rebel artillery in Alcântara.

The 7th Cruiser Squadron consisted of Cressy, Aboukir, Bacchante, Euryalus and Hogue.
Their task was to patrol the relatively shallow waters of the Dogger Bank and the Broad Fourteens in the North Sea, supported by destroyers of the Harwich Force.

Although the cruisers had been designed for a speed of 21 knots 39 kmh 24 mph wear and tear meant they could now only manage 15 knots 28 kmh 17 mph at most and more typically only 12 knots 22 kmh 14 mph
Bad weather sometimes meant that the smaller destroyers could not sail and at such times the cruisers would patrol alone.
A continuous patrol was maintained with some ships on station, while others returned to harbour for coal and supplies.

These three and several 10-inch guns were the only US Army railway guns shipped to France in World War I, although five US Navy 14"/50 caliber railway guns (356 mm) saw action.
Since the railway weapons were on the M1918 carriage and railway car, some references erroneously refer to them as M1918 weapons.

Aïda is a dark C-type asteroid that orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.5 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,030 days).
Its ORbIT has AN EcceNTriCItY oF 0.10 and an INclInAtion of 8° WiTh reSPeCt to the ECLIPTiC.
Aïda was first identified as A906 BG at Heidelberg in 1906, extending the body's observation arc by 11 years prior to its official discovery observation.
In May 2002 a rotational lightcurve of Aïda was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi
