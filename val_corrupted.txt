(A) Senile Animal features Melvins' signature sludge and stoner metal sound.
AllMusic critic Greg Prato noted Although they started out primarily as a punk band that slowed down the riffs the Melvins have also always mixed in prog rocklike bits such as the tricky rhythms of Blood Witch and the King CrimsonToolish The Hawk
The album also contains some of the group's most straightforward compositions in some time, including the metallic/new wave-ish ditty "A History of Drunks."

While the wheel arrangement and type name Atlantic would come to fame in the fast passenger service competition between railroads in the United States by mid-1895, the tank locomotive version of the 4-4-2 Atlantic type first made its appearance in the United Kingdom in 1880, when William Adams designed the 1 Class 4-4-2T of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR).
The 442T is the tank locomotive equivalent of a 440 American type tender locomotive but with the frame extended to allow for a fuel bunker behind the cab

The tender version of the 4-4-2 originated in the United States of America, evolving from the less stable 2-4-2 Columbia type wheel arrangement, and was built especially for mainline passenger express services.

The locomotive was not successful and was scrapped soon afterwards.
The wheel arrangement was named after the second North American 4-4-2 tender locomotive class, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894 for use on the Atlantic City line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway.

In 1897 24 6600 Class Atlantics were built for the 3 ft 6 in 1067 mm gauge Japanese Railways by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States of America
Six more locomotives, built to the same Japanese design, were built for the Cape Government Railways in South Africa immediately following the completion of the Japanese order.
By the 1980s, the last Atlantics at work in the world were a few 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) Cape gauge examples in Mozambique.

In 1897 additional locomotives were urgently required by the Cape Government Railways CGR for the section south of Kimberley at a time when locomotive production in England was being disrupted by strikes while simultaneously the steamship companies had suddenly doubled all their freight rates to the Cape of Good Hope
 As a  result  six locomotiveswere order ed f rom BaldwinLocomotive Works
These were built in addition to a just fulfilled order of 6600 Class Atlantics, built for and to a design by the 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge Japanese Railways.
The locomotives were completed within sixty days of receipt of the order and, to circumvent the exorbitant freight charges of the steamship lines, were shipped to the Cape by sailing ship, with the result that the steamship companies promptly reverted to their old rates.

This was not standard practice in the U.S., however.
The nation's biggest user of the type was the Santa Fe with 178 of the type.
All of these were built with 73 inches (185 centimetres) or 79 inches (201 centimetres) drivers and the drive rods connected to the first pair of driving wheels.
In 1905, Santa Fe engineer Charles Losee was widely reported to have driven Atlantic type 510, a 1904 balanced compound built by Baldwin, the 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometres) from Cameron to Surrey in Illinois with a three car special train in one minute and thirty-five seconds.

Despite their excellent performance, most were retired long before other locomotives of their era, and the few survivors wound up on light local trains.

Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family.
Livingston was distantly related to Moores wife

Admitting that he wrote it "not for publication, but to amuse my children," Moore claimed the Christmas poem in this 1844 letter as his "literary property, however small the intrinsic value of that property may be."
"A Visit from St. Nicholas" appears on pp.
124–27  in Moore'svolum eo f collected Poem s  (New York: Bartl ettand Welfo rd,1844).
Before 1844, the poem was included in two 1840 anthologies: attributed to "Clement C. Moore" in Selections from The American Poets, edited by William Cullen Bryant (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1840), pp.
 285–8 6;andto "C . C. Moore"in th e firstvolu meof T he  Poe ts of America,edit edby John Kees  e(NewYork:S. Co l man,1840),pp.
102–04.
The NewYork Historical Society has a later manuscript of the poem in Moores handwriting forwarded by T W C Moore along with a cover letter dated March 15 1862 giving circumstances of the poems original composition and transmission after a personal interview with Clement C Moore

Moore preferred to be known for his more scholarly works, but allowed the poem to be included in his anthology in 1844 at the request of his children.
By that time, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship.

Kallers findings were confirmed by autograph expert James Lowe by Dr Joe Nickell the author of Pen Ink  Evidence and by others

Four hand-written copies of the poem are known to exist and three are in museums, including the New-York Historical Society library.
The fourth copy written out and signed by Clement Clarke Moore as a gift to a friend in 1860 was sold by one private collector to another in December 2006

The radio soap opera contained within the TV continuity had its own story-line and characters, and in addition the actors and actresses had a separate story-line involving their own conflicts.
The main focus of A Woman to Remember was the backstage drama of a radio serial
Radio soap opera star Christine Baker (Patricia Wheel) was the central heroine who had to spend much of her time dealing with malicious Carol Winstead (Joan Catlin), who fought against her both at work and in Christine's relationship with Steve Hammond (John Raby).

The show was broadcast live from a tiny radio studio in Wanamaker's Department Store, with a budget of $1,750 a week, a three-hour rehearsal period, and, at most, two TV cameras.
The studio bathroom was used as the dressing room, there was little ventilation, the sets were cheap and the actors were barely paid.
One day the air conditioning broke down and five technicians fainted from heat exhaustion
