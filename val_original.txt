In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Ðelekovec was part of the Varaždin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.
On the line-up change, Buzz Osborne spoke to Kerrang!
in 2008, stating:
When it became obvious we wouldn't be working with Kevin again, me and Dale were very discouraged fellows – I was bummed out for 18 months!
We didn't know what we were going to do, but we knew we were going to do something.
We'd played with Big Business and Jared [Warren]'s name had been batted around when we were thinking of bass players but I thought instead of just getting him, why don't we just get both those guys?
We thought about two drummers a long time ago and messed around a little bit but [getting Coady Willis, Big Business' drummer] was the best decision we could have made.
I'm not afraid of making changes and everything's worked out perfectly for everybody including Kevin.
This record is one of my favourites and I think we're just scratching the surface of what we can do with these guys.
A music video for "The Talking Horse" was made and shown in 2007.
The song "A History of Bad Men" appears in the film I Know Who Killed Me and in the TV show True Detective.
(A) Senile Animal features Melvins' signature sludge and stoner metal sound.
AllMusic critic Greg Prato noted: "Although they started out primarily as a punk band that slowed down the riffs, the Melvins have also always mixed in prog rock-like bits, such as the tricky rhythms of "Blood Witch" and the King Crimson/Tool-ish "The Hawk."
The album also contains some of the group's most straightforward compositions in some time, including the metallic/new wave-ish ditty "A History of Drunks."
The vinyl edition was released as a 4-LP box set from Hydra Head Records.
Each LP featured music on one side and an etching on the other.
This was limited to 300 copies in a variety of colors and designs.
In only his second professional season, Lew Alcindor led the league in scoring at 31.7 ppg, ranked second in field goal percentage at .577 and fourth in rebounding at 16.0 rpg.
Newly arrived Oscar Robertson turned 32 early in the 1970–71 season, and was past his prime when he came to Milwaukee, but his versatile skills and experience provided a leadership role for the Bucks.
Robertson had never won a championship and his desire to win seemed to inspire Alcindor and unite the rest of the Bucks.
Robertson ranked third in the league in assists at 8.3 apg and was the Bucks' No.
2 scorer at 19.4 ppg.
On April 21, 1970, the Bucks traded two young players, Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk, to the Cincinnati Royals for 10-year veteran guard Oscar Robertson.
The Spartans finished the 1975–76 season 14–13, 10–8 in Big Ten play to finish in fourth place.
The season marked the last season for Gus Ganakas as Spartan head coach.
The Cavaliers had a record of 14–16, with a conference record of 4–12, under Pete Gillen's first season.
The quarterfinals are best-of-3 series.

The finals are best-of-5 series.
The qualifying competitions for the 2015 CONCACAF U-20 Championship were handled by two regional of CONCACAF's bodies; the Caribbean Football Union (Caribbean zone) and the Central American Football Union (Central American zone).
Representative teams from Canada, Mexico and the United States automatically qualified for the final competition.
The teams taking part in the first round were announced on 21 June 2014.
The group winners and the two best runners-up advanced to the final round.
The final round was hosted in Trinidad and Tobago.
On 22 June 2014, CFU announced that Jamaica would also receive a bye to the Second round, however four days later CONCACAF published that the second-best ranked runner-up would be taking part in the Second round.
The groups and resulting fixtures were changed at a later date.
Antigua and Barbuda were removed and Saint Kitts and Nevis added (no explanation given).
The top two from each group advanced to the 2015 CONCACAF U-20 Championship.
While the wheel arrangement and type name Atlantic would come to fame in the fast passenger service competition between railroads in the United States by mid-1895, the tank locomotive version of the 4-4-2 Atlantic type first made its appearance in the United Kingdom in 1880, when William Adams designed the 1 Class 4-4-2T of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR).
The 4-4-2T is the tank locomotive equivalent of a 4-4-0 American type tender locomotive, but with the frame extended to allow for a fuel bunker behind the cab.
This necessitated the addition of a trailing truck to support the additional weight at the rear end of the locomotive.
As such, the tank version of the 4-4-2 wheel arrangement appeared earlier than the tender version.
The tender version of the 4-4-2 originated in the United States of America, evolving from the less stable 2-4-2 Columbia type wheel arrangement, and was built especially for mainline passenger express services.
One advantage of the type over its predecessor 4-4-0 American type was that the trailing wheels allowed a larger and deeper firebox to be placed behind the driving wheels.
The first use of the 4-4-2 wheel arrangement for a tender locomotive was under an experimental double-firebox locomotive, built to the design of George Strong at the Hinkley Locomotive Works in 1888.
The locomotive was not successful and was scrapped soon afterwards.
The wheel arrangement was named after the second North American 4-4-2 tender locomotive class, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894 for use on the Atlantic City line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway.
Baldwin's ideas on 4-4-2 tender locomotives were soon copied in the United Kingdom, initially by Henry Ivatt of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) with his GNR Class C1 Klondyke Atlantic of 1898.
These were quickly followed by John Aspinall's Class 7, known as the High-Flyer, for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR).
The first European Atlantic locomotive type was the Austro-Hungarian IId class of the Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn (KFNB).
It was built from 1895 and later became the 308 class on the Imperial Royal State Railways (kaiserlich und königlich Staatsbahnen, kkStB).
It was followed from 1901 by the XVIb class of the Austrian Northwestern Railway (Österreichische Nordwestbahn, ÖNWB) that later became the kkStB class 208, and then by the kkStB 108 class.
They were not numerous, though.
All three classes together numbered a little more than one hundred locomotives.
Apart from the Austrian locomotives, the Hungarian State Railways (Magyar Államvasutak or MÁV) also operated some Atlantic classes.
In 1939, the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB) introduced six Class 12 streamlined Atlantic locomotives on the fast lightweight boat trains that ran on the 124 kilometres (77 miles) line between Brussels and Ostend.
Designed by Raoul Notesse to be capable of speeds of 120 to 140 kilometres per hour (75 to 87 miles per hour) and based on the successful Canadian Pacific Railway 4-4-4 Jubilee type semi-streamlined locomotives, but incorporating the ideas on streamlining of André Huet, they were built by John Cockerill at Seraing.
They were fully streamlined, except for openings to provide access to the valve gear and motion, and had inside cylinders with outside valve gear to reduce oscillation at speed.
The class remained in service until 1962.
In India, the broad gauge E class was rebuilt in the 1940s and survived into the 1970s.
In 1897, 24 6600 Class Atlantics were built for the 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge Japanese Railways by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States of America.
Six more locomotives, built to the same Japanese design, were built for the Cape Government Railways in South Africa immediately following the completion of the Japanese order.
By the 1980s, the last Atlantics at work in the world were a few 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) Cape gauge examples in Mozambique.
These survived reported retirements to operate into the beginning of the 21st century, becoming some of the last working steam in the country.
Exceptionally, they had outlasted much larger and newer power, including Garratt locomotives.
In 1897, additional locomotives were urgently required by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) for the section south of Kimberley, at a time when locomotive production in England was being disrupted by strikes, while simultaneously the steamship companies had suddenly doubled all their freight rates to the Cape of Good Hope.
As a result, six locomotives were ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works.
These were built in addition to a just fulfilled order of 6600 Class Atlantics, built for and to a design by the 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge Japanese Railways.
The locomotives were completed within sixty days of receipt of the order and, to circumvent the exorbitant freight charges of the steamship lines, were shipped to the Cape by sailing ship, with the result that the steamship companies promptly reverted to their old rates.
Nicknamed the Hatracks, the locomotives were designated 4th Class on the CGR.
When they came onto South African Railways (SAR) stock in 1912, they were considered obsolete and designated Class 04.
They remained in SAR service until 1931.
Following Henry Ivatt’s GNR Class C1 Klondyke Atlantic of 1898 and John Aspinall's L&YR Class 7 High-Flyer, of which forty were built between 1899 and 1902, a lot of interest was shown in the Atlantic type by British railways during the first decade of the twentieth century, especially for express passenger train service.
Between 1902 and 1908, Ivatt built eighty larger boilered versions of his GNR Class C1, which were known as the Large Boiler Class C1.
These remained in service until the early 1950s.
In 1903, for use in comparative trials against his own designs, George Jackson Churchward of the Great Western Railway (GWR) purchased three French De Glehn compound 4-4-2s, beginning with the GWR no.
102 La France and followed by two larger locomotives in 1905.
Fourteen members of his two-cylinder 2900 Saint class locomotives were subsequently either built or rebuilt with this wheel arrangement, including one four-cylinder GWR 4000 Star class, no.
40 North Star.
All of these were later rebuilt to a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement.
Wilson Worsdell of the North Eastern Railway (NER) designed his classes V and 4CC between 1903 and 1906, while John G. Robinson of the Great Central Railway (GCR) introduced his 8D and 8E classes of three-cylinder compound locomotives in 1905 and 1906.
The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) H1 class, introduced by D. E. Marsh in 1905 and 1906, was copied from the plans of the Ivatt C1 class, with minimal alterations.
In 1911, L.B.
Billinton was granted authority to construct a further six examples incorporating Schmidt superheaters, which became the LB&SCR H2 class.
William Paton Reid of the North British Railway built twenty examples of his North British Atlantic, later known as H class, between 1906 and 1911.
Two more were built after his retirement and the whole class became the LNER C11 Class in the 1923 grouping.
Worsdell's successor on the NER, Vincent Raven, introduced his V1 and Z classes between 1910 and 1917.
By 1918, however, the 4-4-2 type had been largely superseded by the 4-6-0 type in the United Kingdom.
The original Atlantics in the United States were built with the hauling of wood-frame passenger cars in mind and came in a variety of configurations, including the four-cylinder Vauclain compound which had previously been used on express 4-4-0 American, 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler and 2-4-2 Columbia locomotives.
Around the 1910s, railroads started buying heavier steel passenger cars, which precipitated the introduction of the 4-6-2 Pacific type as the standard passenger locomotive.
Nonetheless, the Chicago and North Western, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Pennsylvania railroads used 4-4-2 Atlantics until the bitter end of steam locomotive fleets in the 1950s, with some even being used in light local freight switching service.
One of the best-known groups of 4-4-2s in the United States was the Pennsylvania Railroad's vast fleet of E class Atlantics, culminating in the PRR E6s class.
Although Atlantics were sometimes used as mountain helpers prior to the First World War, they were not well-suited for mountain grades.
They had large-diameter driving wheels, in some cases exceeding 72 inches (1,829 millimetres), which were adequate for 70 to 100 miles per hour (110 to 160 kilometres per hour) trains.
They tended to oscillate at higher speeds when the drive rods were connected to the rear pair of drivers.
This was not standard practice in the U.S., however.
The nation's biggest user of the type was the Santa Fe with 178 of the type.
All of these were built with 73 inches (185 centimetres) or 79 inches (201 centimetres) drivers and the drive rods connected to the first pair of driving wheels.
In 1905, Santa Fe engineer Charles Losee was widely reported to have driven Atlantic type 510, a 1904 balanced compound built by Baldwin, the 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometres) from Cameron to Surrey in Illinois with a three car special train in one minute and thirty-five seconds.
If that had been confirmed by a disinterested party, the 106 miles (171 kilometres) per hour speed would have set a world record.
These were never used on the road's Rocky Mountain grades; even on the flat plains of Kansas the Atlantics were soon overwhelmed by the weight of the newest all-steel, 85 feet (26 metres) passenger cars.
Despite their excellent performance, most were retired long before other locomotives of their era, and the few survivors wound up on light local trains.
The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) used a streamlined Atlantic type on its midwestern Hiawatha passenger train service that was instituted in 1935.
Four 4-4-2 locomotives of the Milwaukee Road class A were constructed for this service in 1935.
These 4-4-2s were reportedly the first steam locomotives ever designed and built to reach 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour) on a daily basis.
These Atlantics with their distinctive streamlining shrouds were designed by industrial designer Otto Kuhler.
Their calculated tractive effort was 30,685 pounds-force (136 kilonewtons).
An unusual feature of this locomotive was the drive onto the front coupled axle, which improved riding quality at speed.
The locomotives were cross balanced and ran on 84 inches (2,134 millimetres) drivers.
They had an oil-fired 69 square feet (6.4 square metres) grate and a rated boiler pressure of 300 pounds per square inch (2,100 kilopascals), which gave the boiler a high capacity in relation to the cylinders.
Designed for a light-weight train of five to six passenger cars, they were considered as probably the fastest steam locomotives ever built in the United States, possibly capable of matching any locomotive in the world.
The fleet covered their 431 miles (694 kilometres) schedule in 400 minutes with several stops en route, at an average speed of more than 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour) on some sections and often arriving with one or two minutes to spare.
None survived, since all four locomotives were withdrawn and scrapped between 1949 and 1951.
On January 16, 2003, a team of astronomers (led by Geoff Marcy) announced the discovery of an extrasolar planet around 54 Piscium using the radial velocity method, a process utilizing the "wobbling" effect that a star may experience if something is tugging on it.
The planet has been estimated to have a mass of only 20 percent that of Jupiter (making the planet around the same size and mass of Saturn).
The planet orbits its sun at a distance of 0.28 astronomical units (which would be within the orbit of Mercury), which takes approximately 62 days to complete.
The planet has a high eccentricity of about 0.63.
The highly elliptical orbit, however, suggested that the gravity of an unseen object farther away from the star was pulling the planet outward.
The eccentric orbit became clear with the discovery of the brown dwarf within the system.
The orbit of an Earth-like planet would need to be centered within 0.68 AU (around the orbital distance of Venus), which in a Keplerian system means a 240-day orbital period.
In a 2006 simulation with the brown dwarf, 54 Piscium b's orbit "sweeps clean" most test particles within 0.5 AU, leaving only asteroids "in low-eccentricity orbits near the known planet’s apastron distance, near the 1:2 mean-motion resonance".
Also, observation has ruled out Neptune-class or heavier planets with a period of one year or less; which still allows for Earth-sized planets at 0.6 AU or more.
13-year-old Conor O'Malley holds a close bond to his seriously ill mother, and maintains the household during her regular chemotherapy treatments at the hospital.
Conor's grandmother often visits, and she suggests that Conor live with her in the event of his mother's death.
Conor is reluctant to take up this offer due to her cold personality.
At school, Conor is ridiculed as a daydreamer and is regularly tormented by his classmate Harry.
Conor is also plagued by a nightmare in which the old church near his house collapses and falls into a hole, where someone else is in danger of plummeting and he tries to hold onto them.
Conor vents his emotions via drawing, a talent he inherited from his mother.
One night, exactly seven minutes past midnight, he awakes from his nightmare to see the large yew tree next to the church transform into a gnarled monster that approaches Conor's home and speaks to him.
The Monster says that it will tell Conor three stories during their next meetings, after which Conor must tell the Monster a fourth tale in return.
In the Monster's first story, a prince escapes from his stepmother, the supposedly-evil queen, with his bride, but then kills his sleeping bride under a yew tree and makes the queen into a scapegoat so that his people can drive the queen away and make him king.
As the condition of Conor's mother worsens, Conor moves in with his grandmother.
Conor's father, who lives in Los Angeles with a new family, visits Conor and invites him to visit his stepfamily on Christmas, which gives Conor hope that he might live with him permanently.
After Conor angrily damages his grandmother's valuable clock, the Monster appears and tells his second story: a hard-hearted parson forbids an apothecary from extracting medicine from an old yew tree, only to rescind this measure when his own children become ill.
However, the apothecary cannot help him, and the Monster begins to destroy the parson's house as punishment.
Conor enthusiastically joins in on the destruction, but comes to find that he has decimated his grandmother's living room.
His grandmother, while bitter, does not punish Conor.
Conor's mother's condition declines further, and her doctors turn to a final treatment involving yew wood.
Conor learns of this and implores the Monster to heal his mother, only for the Monster to dismiss the matter as outside of his responsibility.
At school, Harry proclaims to Conor that he will no longer bother Conor because he "no longer sees [him]".
The Monster appears and tells a story of an invisible man who did not want to be so.
With the Monster's support, Conor attacks Harry and hospitalizes him.
To Conor's astonishment, the headmistress refrains from punishing Conor as she comprehends Conor's current situation.
When it becomes clear that his mother will die, Conor runs to the yew tree, where the Monster forces him to relive his nightmare, in which his mother dangles for her life.
Conor finally admits that he had long suspected that his mother would not survive her illness and secretly hoped that she would die soon, which fills him with guilt.
The Monster tells him that he did not truly want his mother to die, but simply to end his own suffering.
Conor's grandmother finds him asleep under the yew tree and drives him to the hospital, during which Conor reconciles with her.
At the hospital, Conor embraces his mother one last time and as she is passing she glances at the Monster, as if she was, acknowledging its existence.
She dies at seven minutes past noon.
Conor returns to his grandmother's house, where his mother's old room is refurbished for him.
In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.

Tom Holland worked on set as The Monster with Neeson absent.
Originally scheduled for an October 2016 release, the film was delayed in order to avoid competition from Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Boo!
A Madea Halloween, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and Keeping Up with the Joneses.
It was rescheduled for a limited roll out on 23 December 2016, followed by a wide release on 6 January 2017.
The film was released in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2017, by Entertainment One and Lionsgate, and in India on 6 January 2017, by B4U Relativity.
A Monster Calls grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada and $43.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $47.2 million, against a production budget of $43 million.
In North America, the film had its wide release alongside the opening of Underworld: Blood Wars and the wide expansions of Hidden Figures and Lion, and was initially expected to gross around $10 million from 1,523 theaters over the weekend.
However, after making just $659,000 on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $2 million, which it ended up grossing, finishing 13th at the box office.
In its second weekend of wide release it grossed $537,262 (a drop of 74.2%) and in its third week made just $19,080 (a drop of 96.4%) after being pulled from all but 42 theaters, one of the biggest third week theater drops in history.
The aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 86% based on 249 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10.
The site's critical consensus reads, "A Monster Calls deftly balances dark themes and fantastical elements to deliver an engrossing and uncommonly moving entry in the crowded coming-of-age genre".
At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.
On Christmas Eve night, a father, his wife and their children are asleep in their beds, but the father is awakened by noises outside his house.
Looking out the window, he sees Santa Claus (Saint Nicholas) in an air-borne sleigh pulled by eight reindeer.
After landing his sleigh on the roof, Santa enters the house through the chimney, carrying a sack of toys with him.
The father watches Santa fill the stockings hanging by the fireplace, and laughs to himself.
They share a conspiratorial moment before Santa bounds up the chimney again.
As he flies away, Santa wishes a "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night."
The authorship of "A Visit" is credited to Clement Clarke Moore who is said to have composed it on a snowy winter's day during a shopping trip on a sleigh.
His inspiration for the character of Saint Nicholas was a local Dutch handyman as well as the historical Saint Nicholas.
Moore originated many of the features that are still associated with Santa Claus today while borrowing other aspects, such as the use of reindeer.
The poem was first published anonymously in the Troy, New York Sentinel on 23 December 1823, having been sent there by a friend of Moore, and was reprinted frequently thereafter with no name attached.
It was first attributed in print to Moore in 1837.
Moore himself acknowledged authorship when he included it in his own book of poems in 1844.
By then, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship.
Moore had a reputation as an erudite professor and had not wished at first to be connected with the unscholarly verse.
He included it in the anthology at the insistence of his children, for whom he had originally written the piece.
Moore's conception of Saint Nicholas was borrowed from his friend Washington Irving, but Moore portrayed his "jolly old elf" as arriving on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas Day.
At the time that Moore wrote the poem, Christmas Day was overtaking New Year's Day as the preferred genteel family holiday of the season, but some  Protestants viewed Christmas as the result of "Catholic ignorance and deception" and still had reservations.
By having Saint Nicholas arrive the night before, Moore "deftly shifted the focus away from Christmas Day with its still-problematic religious associations."
As a result, "New Yorkers embraced Moore's child-centered version of Christmas as if they had been doing it all their lives."
In An American Anthology, 1787–1900, editor Edmund Clarence Stedman reprinted the Moore version of the poem, including the Dutch spelling of “Donder” and German spelling of "Blitzen" that he adopted, rather than the version from 1823 "Dunder and Blixem" that is more similar to the old Dutch “Donder en Blixem” that translates to "Thunder and Lightning”.
Modern printings frequently incorporate alterations that reflect changing linguistic and cultural sensibilities.
For example, breast in "The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow" is frequently bowdlerized to crest; the archaic ere in "But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight" is frequently replaced with as.
This change implies that Santa Claus made his exclamation during the moment that he disappeared from view, while the exclamation came before his disappearance in the original.
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night" is frequently rendered with the traditional English locution "Merry Christmas".
Moore's connection with the poem has been questioned by Professor Donald Foster, who used textual content analysis and external evidence to argue that Moore could not have been the author.
Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family.
Livingston was distantly related to Moore's wife.
Foster's claim, however, has been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore's original manuscripts of the poem.
Kaller has offered a point-by-point rebuttal of both Foster's linguistic analysis and external findings, buttressed by the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Dr. Joe Nickell, author of Pen, Ink and Evidence.
On January 20, 1829, Troy editor Orville L. Holley alluded to the author of the Christmas poem, using terms that accurately described Moore as a native and current resident of New York City, and as "a gentleman of more merit as a scholar and a writer than many of more noisy pretensions."
In December 1833, a diary entry by Francis P. Lee, a student at General Theological Seminary when Moore taught there, referred to a holiday figure of St. Nicholas as being "robed in fur, and dressed according to the description of Prof. Moore in his poem."
Four poems including "A Visit from St. Nicholas" appeared under Moore's name in The New-York Book of Poetry, edited by Charles Fenno Hoffman (New York: George Dearborn, 1837).
The Christmas poem appears on pp.
217–19, credited to "Clement C.
Moore."
Moore stated in a letter to the editor of the New York American (published on March 1, 1844) that he "gave the publisher" of The New-York Book of Poetry "several pieces, among which was the 'Visit from St.
Nicholas.'"
Admitting that he wrote it "not for publication, but to amuse my children," Moore claimed the Christmas poem in this 1844 letter as his "literary property, however small the intrinsic value of that property may be."
"A Visit from St. Nicholas" appears on pp.
124–27 in Moore's volume of collected Poems (New York: Bartlett and Welford, 1844).
Before 1844, the poem was included in two 1840 anthologies: attributed to "Clement C. Moore" in Selections from The American Poets, edited by William Cullen Bryant (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1840), pp.
285–86; and to "C. C. Moore" in the first volume of The Poets of America, edited by John Keese (New York: S. Colman, 1840), pp.
102–04.
The New-York Historical Society has a later manuscript of the poem in Moore's handwriting, forwarded by T. W. C. Moore along with a cover letter dated March 15, 1862 giving circumstances of the poem's original composition and transmission after a personal "interview" with Clement C. Moore.
After "A Visit from St. Nicholas" appeared under Moore's name in the 1837 New-York Book of Poetry, newspaper printings of the poem often credited Moore as the author.
For example, the poem is credited to "Professor Moore" in the 25 December 1837 Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier.
Although Moore did not authorize the earliest publication of the poem in the Troy Sentinel, he had close ties to Troy through the Protestant Episcopal Church that could explain how it got there.
Harriet Butler of Troy, New York (daughter of the Rev.
David Butler) who allegedly showed the poem to Sentinel editor Orville L. Holley, was a family friend of Moore's and possibly a distant relative.
A letter to Moore from the publisher Norman Tuttle states, "I understand from Mr. Holley that he received it from Mrs. Sackett, the wife of Mr. Daniel Sackett who was then a merchant in this city".
The reported involvement of two women, Harriet Butler and Sarah Sackett, as intermediaries is consistent with the 1862 account of the poem's earliest transmission in which T. W. C. Moore describes two stages of copying, first "by a relative of Dr Moores in her Album" and second, "by a friend of hers, from Troy."
Moore preferred to be known for his more scholarly works, but allowed the poem to be included in his anthology in 1844 at the request of his children.
By that time, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship.
Livingston family lore gives credit to their forebear rather than Moore, but there is no proof that Livingston himself ever claimed authorship, nor has any record ever been found of any printing of the poem with Livingston's name attached to it, despite more than 40 years of searches.
Advocates for Livingston's authorship argue that Moore "tried at first to disavow" the poem.
They also posit that Moore falsely claimed to have translated a book.
Document dealer and historian Seth Kaller has challenged both claims.
Kaller examined the book in question, A Complete Treatise on Merinos and Other Sheep, as well as many letters signed by Moore, and found that the "signature" was not penned by Moore, and thus provides no evidence that Moore made any plagiaristic claim.
Kaller's findings were confirmed by autograph expert James Lowe, by Dr. Joe Nickell, the author of Pen, Ink & Evidence, and by others.
According to Kaller, Moore's name was likely written on the book by a New-York Historical Society cataloger to indicate that it had been a gift from Moore to the Society.
The following points have been advanced in order to credit the poem to Major Henry Livingston Jr.:
Livingston also wrote poetry primarily using an anapaestic metrical scheme, and it is claimed that some of the phraseology of A Visit is consistent with other poems by Livingston, and that Livingston's poetry is more optimistic than Moore's poetry published in his own name.
But Stephen Nissenbaum argues in his Battle for Christmas that the poem could have been a social satire of the Victorianization of Christmas.
Furthermore, Kaller claims that Foster cherry-picked only the poems that fit his thesis and that many of Moore's unpublished works have a tenor, phraseology, and meter similar to A Visit.
Moore had even written a letter titled "From Saint Nicholas" that may have predated 1823.
Foster also contends that Moore hated tobacco and would, therefore, never have depicted Saint Nicholas with a pipe.
However, Kaller notes, the source of evidence for Moore's supposed disapproval of tobacco is The Wine Drinker, another poem by him.
In actuality, that verse contradicts such a claim.
Moore's The Wine Drinker criticizes self-righteous, hypocritical advocates of temperance who secretly indulge in the substances which they publicly oppose, and supports the social use of tobacco in moderation (as well as wine, and even opium, which was more acceptable in his day than it is now).
 Foster also asserts that Livingston's mother was Dutch, which accounts for the references to the Dutch Sinteklaes tradition and the use of the Dutch names "Dunder and Blixem".
Against this claim, it is suggested by Kaller that Moore – a friend of writer Washington Irving and member of the same literary society – may have acquired some of his knowledge of New York Dutch traditions from Irving.
Irving had written A History of New York in 1809 under the name of "Dietrich Knickerbocker."
It includes several references to legends of Saint Nicholas, including the following that bears a close relationship to the poem:
And the sage Oloffe dreamed a dream,‍—‌and lo, the good St. Nicholas came riding over the tops of the trees, in that self-same wagon wherein he brings his yearly presents to children, and he descended hard by where the heroes of Communipaw had made their late repast.
And he lit his pipe by the fire, and sat himself down and smoked; and as he smoked, the smoke from his pipe ascended into the air and spread like a cloud overhead.
And Oloffe bethought him, and he hastened and climbed up to the top of one of the tallest trees, and saw that the smoke spread over a great extent of country; and as he considered it more attentively, he fancied that the great volume of smoke assumed a variety of marvelous forms, where in dim obscurity he saw shadowed out palaces and domes and lofty spires, all of which lasted but a moment, and then faded away, until the whole rolled off, and nothing but the green woods were left.
And when St. Nicholas had smoked his pipe, he twisted it in his hatband, and laying his finger beside his nose, gave the astonished Van Kortlandt a very significant look; then, mounting his wagon, he returned over the tree-tops and disappeared.

MacDonald P. Jackson, Emeritus Professor of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, has spent his entire academic career analyzing authorship attribution.
He has written a book titled Who Wrote "the Night Before Christmas"?
: Analyzing the Clement Clarke Moore Vs. Henry Livingston Question, published in 2016, in which he evaluates the opposing arguments and, for the first time, uses the author-attribution techniques of modern computational stylistics to examine the long-standing controversy.
Jackson employs a range of tests and introduces a new one, statistical analysis of phonemes; he concludes that Livingston is the true author of the classic work.
The poem has been set to music by composer Ken Darby (1909–1992) and by British child composer Alma Deutscher (b.
2005).
Four hand-written copies of the poem are known to exist and three are in museums, including the New-York Historical Society library.
The fourth copy, written out and signed by Clement Clarke Moore as a gift to a friend in 1860, was sold by one private collector to another in December 2006.
It was purchased for $280,000 by an unnamed "chief executive officer of a media company" who resides in New York City, according to Dallas, Texas-based Heritage Auctions which brokered the private sale.
The concept of the soap opera was novel: the idea was that viewers would get two soap operas in one.
The radio soap opera contained within the TV continuity had its own story-line and characters, and in addition the actors and actresses had a separate story-line involving their own conflicts.
The main focus of A Woman to Remember was the backstage drama of a radio serial.
Radio soap opera star Christine Baker (Patricia Wheel) was the central heroine who had to spend much of her time dealing with malicious Carol Winstead (Joan Catlin), who fought against her both at work and in Christine's relationship with Steve Hammond (John Raby).
Other characters included Christine's actress pal Bessie Thatcher (Ruth McDevitt) and sound man Charley Anderson (Frankie Thomas).
Thomas would later star in popular series Tom Corbett, Space Cadet.
His mother, Mona Bruns (who appeared on many soaps), had a small part on the show and described the backstage atmosphere as very hectic.
The show was broadcast live from a tiny radio studio in Wanamaker's Department Store, with a budget of $1,750 a week, a three-hour rehearsal period, and, at most, two TV cameras.
The studio bathroom was used as the dressing room, there was little ventilation, the sets were cheap and the actors were barely paid.
One day, the air conditioning broke down and five technicians fainted from heat exhaustion.
Bruns had to say, "I've just had a tooth pulled," but was so delirious, she said (live on air), "I've just had a pooth tulled."
The actors struggled not to laugh, which kept them from fainting from the heat.
Leading man Raby once had a scene with an actress who panicked once the broadcast began.
She tried to flee the set, but he pushed her into a chair and kept her there.
He blurted out, "I can guess what you came to tell me," and proceeded to recite all of her dialogue, along with his own lines.
After the scene ended he went to the bathroom and threw up.
For many years, A Woman to Remember was considered the first television soap opera, due to some magazine articles which erroneously claimed the series debuted in 1947.
However, DuMont's Faraway Hill, which ran for several months in 1946, is now considered the first soap opera on television.
Acropora secale is a colonial coral that forms low hummocks.
The branches can grow to a diameter of 20 mm (0.8 in) and length of 70 millimetres (2.8 in).
They are cylindrical but gradually taper towards the tips.
They grow in a corymbose fashion with the lower branches being longer than the upper ones so that the coral has a level-topped appearance.
The corallites are of varying sizes and arranged in vertical rows, often with alternate rows of larger and smaller corallites.
The axial corallites are up to 3 millimetres (0.12 in) in diameter while the radial corallites either have long tubular openings or nariform (noselike) openings.
The skeleton is covered by a thin ectodermal layer of tissue.
When feeding, the polyps protrude from the corallites.
Each has a single ring of twelve tentacles, one of which is longer than the others.
The polyps have a mouth which opens into the coelenteron.
This interconnects with other polyps through a complex system of channels, the coenenchyme, inside the porous skeleton.
Several colour schemes occur in this coral, purple with yellow tips to the branches, pale brown with blue tips, plain green or plain brown.
Acropora secale is found in the tropical waters of the west Indo-Pacific including the coasts of East Africa, Mozambique, Rodrigues, Aldabra and Chagos.
It is also found further east around Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and north and west Australia.
It is a reef-building coral and occurs at depths down to 5 metres (16 ft) on outer reef flats, reef slopes, reef edges and walls.
Acropora secale is a zooxanthellate species of coral.
This means that it has symbiotic dinoflagellates living within its tissues.
These, combined with pigments in the tissue, are responsible for the colour of the colony.
Acropora secale is a hermaphrodite and both female gonads and testes are present and mature once a year.
The colonies release eggs and sperm simultaneously, usually six days after the full moon, in November in the Southern Hemisphere and in June in the Northern Hemisphere.
Fertilisation is external; the developing larvae form part of the plankton and drift with the current before settling on the seabed.
Adolphus Goldsmith, also known as Adolphe Goldschmidt, (6 May 1798 – 1876) was a politician in colonial Victoria (Australia), a member of the first Victorian Legislative Council.
Goldsmith was born in London, England, the son of Lion Abraham Goldschmidt and Adelaide (Adelheid) Hertz.
Goldsmith arrived in Melbourne on 30 June 1841 aboard the Caroline.
Goldsmith acquired the pastoral lease for Trawallo (known later as Trewalla - see Trawalla, Victoria) later in 1841.
He was appointed a territorial magistrate on 26 March 1844.
Goldmith was a member of the Melbourne Club and a friend of Sir Redmond Barry.
Goldsmith was elected to the district of Ripon, Hampden, Grenville and Polwarth in the inaugural Victorian Legislative Council on 6 September 1851.
He resigned from the Council in November 1853 and retired to Paris, France, where he died in 1876.
Before Akmal Nasir became a Member of Parliament, he was the founder and director of an NGO called National Oversight and Whistleblowers Centre (NOW) together with Rafizi Ramli.
NOW Malaysia is the NGO that was responsible in exposing national financial scandals during the reign of former Prime Minister, Najib Razak.
Some of them include alleged corruption in National Feedlot Corporation (NFC) that involved Shahrizat Abdul Jalil and alleged misuse of funds of Malaysian Islamic Economy Development Foundation (YaPEIM).
In the 2018 Malaysian general election, he contested the Johor Bahru parliamentary seat under the ticket of Pakatan Harapan and won a two-way contest against Shahrir Abdul Samad representing Barisan Nasional.
Akmal Nasir had contested the People's Justice Party (PKR) Youth Wing Chief in 2018 party election which he won by securing a narrow victory.
In May 2019 Akmal Nasir had caused an uproar when he attended an interfaith breaking fast event at a Sikh gurdwara in Johor Bahru during the Ramadan fasting month for Muslim.
He was rebuked by the Sultan Ibrahim of Johor for his insensitive action.
Somehow, the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department for Religious Affairs, Mujahid Yusof Rawa had clarify that it is not an issue with Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast at a non-Muslim house of worship and Akmal Nasir's attendance as an MP will only help to foster better ties between the races and eliminate Islamophobia.

Moffat was born in Perth in 1870.
His father, George Moffat, was a convict who had been transported to Western Australia in 1850 for the crime of forgery.
Moffat's first involvement with high-level sport came at the age of 18, when was elected secretary and treasurer of the Victorian Football Club (a WAFA foundation club) for the 1888 season.
After a couple seasons at lower levels, he made his senior WAFA debut as a player in 1891, playing for the newly created East Perth Football Club (no relation to the current club of the same name).
East Perth was disbanded at the end of the 1892 season, and Moffat subsequently switched to West Perth.
His final club was Rovers, for which he played only during the 1895 season.
Outside of football, Moffat played club cricket (grade cricket) for the West Perth Cricket Club, as a right-arm medium-pace bowler.
In early 1893, he was selected for Western Australia's tour of the eastern colonies, which was the first such tour to be organised.
Moffat played in his team's matches against South Australia (at Adelaide Oval) and Victoria (at the Melbourne Cricket Ground), both of which would later be granted first-class status.
Western Australia lost both matches by large margins, with Moffat going wicketless in the first game and taking a single wicket (that of Harry Stuckey) in the second.
Moffat served as the Perth Football Club's delegate to the WAFL from 1903 to 1919.
He was elected president of the league in 1920 (having earlier been a vice-president), and served until 1932, when he resigned due to a dispute over player clearances.
Moffat also served as president of the Australian Football Council (AFC), the nationwide governing body for Australian football, from 1924 to 1929.
After leaving his more high-profile positions, he remained involved with the sport as president of the West Australian Amateur Football Association (WAAFA).
Moffat died in Perth in 1956, aged 86.
He had been made a life member of the WAFL in 1909, a life member of the Perth Football Club in 1910, and a life member of the AFC in 1927.
In 2011, Moffat was posthumously inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame.
He was cited as "one of the critical fosterers of the early growth of the game in Western Australia".

Until the Chosun Dynasty, alcohol was mainly served in jumaks (a type of inn or tavern), where soups with rice, along with traditional alcohol such as makgeolli, were served to guests.
Since the introduction of beer and Western foods into Korea, mainly from Japan in the nineteenth century, bars and pubs have enjoyed a newfound popularity, and many types of Western foods have been consumed as anju.
nowadays, anju is good market source of grocers.
Some foods are considered to be best complemented by certain types of alcohol.
For example, samgyeopsal, grilled pork belly, is considered to go best with soju, while fried chicken or Korean seasoned chicken goes well with beer.
Pa-jun and makkeoli (or dongdongju) is a popular combination for rainy days.
Anna Maria von Baden-Durlach was a daughter of Margrave Georg Friedrich von Baden from his second marriage to Agathe Erbach.
After the early death of her mother (1621) she grew up under the care of her "faithful Starschedelin" in the Margrave's Dragon Castle on the Ill in Strasbourg.
Like her younger sister Elisabeth, she received a thorough education, although at the time the Thirty Years War was worsening.
She had a poetic and artistic talent, and quite early she began to write and paint.

She wrote poems and sayings.
"They are free of baroque tears and express their instructive wisdom and their simple-religious meaning in a pleasing way.
The poetic element is small, but the God-given view of life finds and gives consolation".
"Some examples of headings may illustrate their moral purpose and life experience: Anger is an evil of all evils .
A faithful friend is a great treasure , praise of humility , thought from eternity ,Beauty passes, virtue persists."
Anna Maria of Baden-Durlach also wrote a longer poem about the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus (1647), a lovely bukolika on "the Lord's President Selmmitzen Feldgut zu Berghausen".
She also translated poems from Italian and French, occasional poems wrote to name days.
Her literary work was not published during her lifetime.
